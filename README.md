      <h1>What is a GameJam?</h1>
    </summary>
  </ul>
</div>

A Game Jam is a short event where you and others work together to create a small game. Most Jams have some kind of restriction on theme or style to get you thinking about games in a new way. Game Jams are a great way to test ideas, build on your skills, and meet other awesome creative people. Do them. Future you will thank you for it. Pirate Software runs Game Jams two times a year and all of our jams have prizes!

<h3 align="center"> You Are The Weapon </h3>

This theme can be expressed in a number of different ways. Maybe you are cursed and become a weapon that other characters have to wield. Maybe you're an integrated organism that pilots a world destroying gun. Maybe you're Doom Guy. He's basically just a weapon, let's be real. Or even taking it a different direction maybe you're a weapon that kills things like viruses and saves people.

<br/>

Whatever the case you exist to influence your surroundings in some direct way. Have fun with the theme and do something weird with it. Themes are like a box you have to find your way out of. An escape room for game development. Be creative.
