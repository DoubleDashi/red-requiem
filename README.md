      <h1>What is a GameJam?</h1>
    </summary>
  </ul>
</div>

A Game Jam is a short event where you and others work together to create a small game. Most Jams have some kind of restriction on theme or style to get you thinking about games in a new way. Game Jams are a great way to test ideas, build on your skills, and meet other awesome creative people. Do them. Future you will thank you for it. Pirate Software runs Game Jams two times a year and all of our jams have prizes!

      <h1>Theme</h1>
    </summary>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3 align="center"> You Are The Weapon </h3>

This theme can be expressed in a number of different ways. Maybe you are cursed and become a weapon that other characters have to wield. Maybe you're an integrated organism that pilots a world destroying gun. Maybe you're Doom Guy. He's basically just a weapon, let's be real. Or even taking it a different direction maybe you're a weapon that kills things like viruses and saves people.

<br/>

Whatever the case you exist to influence your surroundings in some direct way. Have fun with the theme and do something weird with it. Themes are like a box you have to find your way out of. An escape room for game development. Be creative.

### Game Design Document
* This is a planning document that details what your game will be.
* This is a required part of your submission and a best practice so don't forget it!
* You MUST submit your GDD as a Google Drive file not a downloadable PDF
* Sample GDD https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl7BMvzUOhbunJrI_X1gUc6x-LAp3aaBiPwHUf27B70

### Prototype
* This is a very limited working copy of your game.
* Focus on playability over anything else.
* If it doesn't run, it won't win.
* Your Prototype MUST run as a browser upload here on itch.io.
* The reason this is required is for ease of judging and reduction in malware.
* Winners will be announced during the daily dev stream! https://piratesoftware.live/

      <h1>Voting criteria</h1>
    </summary>
  </ul>
</div>

The judging team will vote on four major categories for each entry in the Jam. As games are subjective media these categories are guidelines for judges to follow when exploring your game. Don't worry about tricking the judges into liking your game. Use these criteria as loose guidelines to make the best game possible. Don't overthink it.

<br/>
<br/>

### Playability
* Were systems in your game clunky or polished?
* Was the game tripping over itself when the judges tried to play it?
* Focus on playability and make sure your build works.
* This is the most important category and counts for a lot.

### Theme implementation
* Did your game follow the theme?
* Was the theme entirely ignored?
* Did you implement the theme in a clever and interesting way?

### Cleverness
* Did you have an ingenious mechanic in your game?
* Maybe you told a story with a very interesting or unique twist.
* The more clever you are the more likely you are to win.

### Artistic style
* Everyone has a style that they like or enjoy.
* Style is not bound only to Triple A assets from major studios.
* Pixel Art, Midi Songs, Foley work and more all ooze with artistic style.
* Just make something YOU think works and run with it.

### Judges choice
* Every judge is different and games are subjectively valuable.
* Each judge is free to vote how they wish and they may find gems that are special to them.
* This category is for each judges favorite games to add extra weight to them.
